David Hill Personal Website/ testing ground

What is intended to become a new version of my personal site 

Might look like a massively overcomplicated build process but using this as a test project to use an all Node build process, 

 * LibSass sass compiling
 * linting of Javascript, css and html, exploring which rules to enforce
 * Combination/Minification of all the things
 * Building front-end static libs dependancies using Bower
  
 To-do:
  * Unit testing of javascript using Karma and Jasmine
  * Utilise Browser sync http://browsersync.io
